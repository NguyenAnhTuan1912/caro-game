# Caro game front-end application
I build the frontend application with:
- React ([view](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react))
- Typescript ([view](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript))
- Redux Toolkits ([view](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reduxjs/toolkit))
- React Redux ([view](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux))
- Vite ([view](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite))
- Tunanguyen React Modal (My NPM package) ([view](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tunangn-react-modal))
- SocketIO (for client) ([view](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io-client))

## How to run?
First, You must install all required packages in `package.json` file with the command below
```
npm install
```

Waiting for the packages installing... After the install process is done, run
```
npm run dev
```

The source fo APP will be built with vite, and the app is hosted in `http://localhost:5173` or `http://<your-local-ip>:5173` or another port that vite provides.
